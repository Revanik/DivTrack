### Understanding the Dashboard

- **Initial Investment**: Your total original investment amount
- **Total Dividends**: Cumulative dividend income received
- **Recovery Progress**: Percentage of principal recovered through dividends
- **Post-Recovery Gains**: Income earned after recovering your principal
- **Monthly Chart**: Visual representation of dividend income over time

## Security & Privacy

- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally on your device
- **No Credentials**: The app never stores Robinhood login information
- **File Processing**: CSV files are processed and immediately deleted
- **Self-Hosted**: Run entirely on your own machine or server

## Data Structure

The app stores data in `dividend_data.json`:

```json
{
  "initial_investment": 10000.00,
  "total_dividends": 8500.00,
  "principal_recovered": false,
  "recovery_date": null,
  "post_recovery_gains": 0.00,
  "transactions": [...],
  "monthly_totals": {...}
}
```

## CSV Format Support

The app automatically detects common Robinhood CSV column names:
- Date columns: `Date`, `date`, `Date/Time`, `date/time`
- Description columns: `Description`, `description`, `Details`, `details`
- Amount columns: `Amount`, `amount`, `Net Amount`, `net amount`

## Dividend Detection

The app identifies dividend transactions by looking for these keywords in the description:
- `dividend`
- `div`
- `distribution`

## Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
```

### Production Server
```bash
# For production, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

### Docker (Optional)
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No dividends found in CSV**
   - Ensure the CSV contains dividend transactions
   - Check that the file is from Robinhood account history
   - Verify the CSV format matches expected columns

2. **Upload errors**
   - Make sure the file is a valid CSV
   - Check file size (should be reasonable for account history)
   - Ensure proper file permissions

3. **Chart not displaying**
   - Requires JavaScript enabled in browser
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure Chart.js is loading properly

### Data Backup

The app automatically creates backups when resetting data:
- Backup files are named: `backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- Keep these files safe if you need to restore data
